# FinGPT - TransformerPrediction

We will evaluate the ability of Meta’s Llama 2-7B to predict stock prices, and then attempt to enhance this ability by fine-tuning the model using a custom dataset.

Overall Vision:

Step 1 - Prediction:

- We will test Llama 2’s ability to predict stock prices using a given data-set from Yahoo Finance.

Step 2 - Modification:

- We will repeatedly modify the cross-entropy loss function and test results, improving prediction capabilities over time.

Step 3 - Analysis:

- Another RCOS group is working with the same data set and using linear regression methods to predict the stock market. When finished, we will measure ROI and risk from both models to find the optimal model/application for stock market prediction.

Stack: Python, HuggingFace, Llama 2, Google Gemma, Google Colab, GitHub

Semester Specific Goals:

- Assess model’s capabilities
  - Create testing datasets from largely traded stocks
  - Assess performance by calculating predicted data accuracies
- Improve prediction capabilities by 5%
  - Identify highest performing model parameters
  - Use datasets to fine-tune open source large language models
  - Integrate external data sources, such as macroeconomic indicators, industry-specific data, or news/media sentiment
  - Investigate methods for preprocessing and incorporating these additional features into the model.
- Achieve 10% hypothetical ROI
  - Identify different metrics to verify the effectiveness of the return of our model

Milestones :

Step 1 - Basics: By Feb. 9

- Learn basics of transformer architecture and implementation
- Learn how to use PyTorch
- Set up development Environment (Colab)
- Process and clean Yahoo Finance data-set
- Get results from predictions

Step 2 - Modification: By March

- Gain deep understanding of the interaction the entropy-loss function has with the output and the rest of the model
- Improve prediction capabilities - a continuous process

Step 3 - Analysis: By End of Semester
