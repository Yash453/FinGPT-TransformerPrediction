Learned About what makes transformer models different:
Transformer models stand out from other AI learning models due to their self-attention mechanism, which enables them to capture long-range dependencies in input sequences efficiently. They also utilize parallelizable architecture without recurrence or convolution, making them highly effective for various sequence-to-sequence tasks such as natural language processing.
.
Learned about training and loss function:
Our goal for this project is to improve the model’s stock prediction abilities by improving its cross entropy loss function. This is a function that models the error of the model, the difference between the correct/best output and the actual output. This isn’t a function that we alter , it is one that the machine optimizes itself through training on the inputted data and our params we input.

Learned about data:
Must be in this format
{"input": "What day is it?", "output": "wednesday."}
