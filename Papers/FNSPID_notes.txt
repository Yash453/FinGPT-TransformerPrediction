 - Dataset is created with the intention to take advantage of advancements in large language models to predict stock prices using sentiment and numerical data

 - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
 - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH)

Construction of FNSPID Dataset:
 - Used Yahoo Finance API to collect stock price data
 - Used Selenium to scrape financial news from NASDAQ due to restrictions on data from other financial news sites
 - Sentiment alaysis Methods NLTK, TextBlob, BERT were used but were tested but deemed not as effective as ChatGPT
  
Experiment with Dataset:
 - Transformer model performed better than alternative models with larger number of training stocks
