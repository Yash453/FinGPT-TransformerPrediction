Time Series Tokenization Design:
- converting numerical values of time series data into string-based tokens discussed in Xue and Salim 2023 paper
- Patch representation for time series
    - How do we do different tokenization methods in application? 
    - Example papers that use Patch representation for time series:
        - One Fits All (OFA) [Zhou et al., 2023],
        - LLM4TS [Chang et al., 2023], TEST [Sun et al., 2024],
        - TEMPO [Cao et al., 2024], and Time-LLM [Jin et al., 2024]
