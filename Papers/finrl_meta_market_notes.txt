The paper presents FinRL-Meta, a library for financial reinforcement learning research

Project Description:
- A major challenge is creating realistic market simulations to train and test RL agents
- There is often a gap between simulated and real world performance
- FinRL-Meta provides a pipeline to automatically process raw financial data into training environments following a standard Gym API
- This allows accessing data from diverse sources and incorporating real market frictions like trading costs
- The library reproduces experiments from published papers as benchmarks for further research
- This includes tasks like stock trading, cryptocurrency trading and portfolio allocation
- Benchmark results on metrics like Sharpe ratio and cumulative return are shared on cloud platforms for community competitions

Learning:
- Dozens of Python demo notebooks are provided for educating new users(find links)
- The notebooks are organized into a curriculum

Future work:
- Future work includes expanding the universe of market environments, especially using generative models to better simulate real markets

General Idea (tldr):
FinRL-Meta creates an open infrastructure to advance the adoption of financial RL in live trading systems
